# Optimization-Algorithms
These notebooks give visualizations for different numerical optimization algorithms applied to linear regression problems.  
It offers my interpretation of the the differences between different optimization techniques, the problems they might face and the effects of different hyperparameters on the learning process.

Algorithms covered:
- Batch Gradient Descent
- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Mini-batch Gradient Descent
- Momentum-based Gradient Descent
- Nestrov Accelearted Gradient (NAG)
- Adaptive Gradient (AdaGrad)
- Root Mean Squared Propagation (RMSProp)
- Adaptive Moment Estimation (ADAM)

Libraries used:
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
